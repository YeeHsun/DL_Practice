DL_Practice
===
Deep learning practice for students to play with popular deep learning frameworks.

## Description
The practice includes 2 different tasks
* [Classification](https://github.com/mediaic/DL_Practice/tree/master/1_Classification) : Students will train a simple neural network classifier and play with many training tricks.
* [Segmentation](https://github.com/mediaic/DL_Practice/tree/master/2_Segmentation) : Students will learn the skills of transfer learning using pre-trained CNNs.

## Rules
Students are required to finish their works using either [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch) or [TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow). We encourage you to learn [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch) if you are the beginner to deep learning since we provide detailed tutorial in the crash courses.

## Prerequisites
* python3.5+
* CUDA 9.0
* cuDNN 7
* TensorFlow 1.6 : pip3 install tensorflow-gpu==1.6  
or  
* Pytorch 0.4.0 :  
pip3 install http://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu90/torch-0.4.0-cp35-cp35m-linux_x86_64.whl  
pip3 install torchvision  

You can also use the insall script in Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.
